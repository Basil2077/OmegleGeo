# OmegleGeo
Python Script that grabs the IP Address of anyone you're connected to through omegle and locates their IP.
Works by filtering network packets pre the connection and then filtering omegle packets

Steps:
1- Enter your local IP address when you first run the script
2- Wait for the script to finish filtering (maximum of 10 seconds)
3- Enter omegle and start a video call
4- Click enter to prompt the program to give you the IP Address + Location of the person you're connected with.
5- Click Enter to replay step 4 after you have connected to another person
6- Click no to end the execution.

Note: Uses regex to filter out all omegle subnets.
Code is only one .py file.
